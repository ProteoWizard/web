    Licensor delivers the software for free, Licensor is not liable for any kind of
    damage, direct or indirect, which may arise due to simple negligence (Section

  <p style='text-autospace:none'><span style='font-family:

    has no obligation to fix, update, supplement or support <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> and/or the <span class=SpellE>CompassXtract</span> Libraries.</span></p>

    Agreement is governed by German law to the exclusion of the UN Convention on
    Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. If you are a consumer, this does
    not apply if legal provisions, in particular consumer protection legislation,
    conflict with this choice. The courts of Bremen shall have exclusive
    jurisdiction. If you are not a merchant, a legal entity under public law or a
    public-law special fund in the sense Section 38 of the German Code of Civil
    Procedure (ZPO), the <span class=GramE>agreement on the place of jurisdiction
    is replaced by the legal provisions</span>.</span></p>

    undertake to substitute the invalid or lacking provision with a valid <span
class=GramE>provision which</span> comes closest to the documented intentions
    of the Parties.</span></p>
